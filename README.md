# RISC-V-32I
This project implements a single-cycle CPU core in Verilog, fully compatible with the RISC-V RV32I base integer instruction set. The design is modular, easy to understand, and intended for educational and small-scale embedded systems use. It strictly follows the encoding and behavior outlined in the RISC-V specification.
